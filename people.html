        <p>Serena is a Professor of Astronomy at Leiden Observatory at Leiden University and leads the MOPPEX project. She also holds a position at University College London.</p><p> Her research interests lie within the field of astrochemistry and galactic and extragalactic star formation studies, both by observations and modelling, with emphasis on the use of chemical and dynamical models to study the clumpy nature of the ISM, and star forming regions.

        <h2> Mathilde Bouvier </h2>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University. My main focus is to investigate the chemical content and the physical properties of nearby galaxies, in pqrticular NGC1068 and NGC253, by targeting various species. In particular, I have a soft spot for carbon chains. I mainly use ALMA observations coupled with chemical models.</p>
        <p> I have interest in both extra-galactic and galactic domain, where I come from. During my PhD thesis, I used millimetre and centimetre interferometric observation (ALMA, NOEMA, VLA) of molecular species to study the chemical content of low-mass protostars located in Orion, considered as the closest and best analogue to the Sun’s birth environment.</p>

        <h2> Katarzyna (Kasia) Dutkowska </h2>
        <p>Kasia is a postdoctoral researcher at Leiden Observatory. She focuses on the modeling of shock chemistry, which can help predict and analyze extragalactic astrochemical observations of shocked regions. She is especially interested in fine-tuning our predictions for dust-related species. Besides, Kasia is interested in observations of molecules in nearby and high-z galaxies.</p>
        <p> In her previous projects, Kasia worked on combining observations with modeling to study star formation and chemistry of the Galactic and extragalactic star-forming regions. She developed her own modeling tool, the so-called galaxy-in-a-box model, which predicts molecular emission arising from active and current star formation in galaxies.</p>

        <h2> Joshua Butterworth </h2>
        <p>He is a PhD student at Leiden Observatory, working with Serena. His work involves using Molecular Line Ratios to investigate the ISM in multi-component galaxies, currently NGC 1068. He is accomplishing this by comparing Archival line intensity detections for many different molecules and transitions of varying spatial resolutions.</p><p>He completed his Master’s at Lancaster University, investigating the co-evolution of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies in both Bulgeless and Classical Bulge Galaxies via Bayesian Inference of CLOUDY models on X-ray Data..</p>

        <h2> Monica Huang </h2>
        <p><a href="https://mxhuang.wordpress.com">Monica</a> is a Taiwanese citizen and an astronomer. She currently works as a 
        postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University. Her main focus is 
        to investigate the chemical & physical properties in the nearby galaxies 
        with interferometric observations from ALMA, along with modeling 
        analysis.</p><p> She used to work with spectral-line polarization data from ALMA, 
        VLA, and CARMA to study the magnetic field morphology around 
        star-forming regions and the circumstellar envelope of AGB stars.
        Beside work, She also loves to bike & hike. Recently in the midst of 
        pandemic she started (self-)learning to play guitar. "</p>
